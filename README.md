# Neural_network
The simplest definition of neural network mostly referred to as Artificial neural network is:
        "A computing system made up of a simple, highly interconnected processing elements called as neurons which process information by their dynamic state response to external inputs."

Or you can also think ANN as a computational model that is inspired by the way Biological neural networks in the human brain process information.
ANNs are processing devices (algorithms or actual hardware) that are loosely modeled after the neuronal structure of the mamalian cerebral cortex but on much smaller scales. A large ANN might have hundreds or thousands of processor units, whereas a mamalian brain has billions of neurons with a corresponding increase in magnitude of their overall interaction and emergent behavior. Although ANN researchers are generally not concerned with whether their networks accurately resemble biological systems, some have. 

Basics of Neural Network

Neural networks are typically organised in layers. Layers are made up of a number of interconnected "nodes" which contains actication function. Patterns are presented to a network via input layer which communicates to one or more hidden layers where
